# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  To understand what users take away from the website.    |  What are you getting out of the website?              |
| To identify who they believe the website is targeting.     |  Who do you think the target audience is?               |

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 | Interview 4 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| What are you getting out of the website? | That UPFs are bad.          | Things are tiered within our nutrition system, so I learned about that, and I learned about targeted ads about certain communities.           |  UPFs are bad for health and affect marginalized communities more than others.           |     I got that UPFs are very prevalent and they were related to the top 3 causes of death in the US and that some communities are more vulnerable than other.        |
| Who do you think the target audience is?                        |  Activists, general population, voter base. |  U.S. citizens.           |   The general public, policy makers, executives of affordable/green food production.          |  It’s hard to say anything but general audience, I don’t think it’s for congresspeople, could be for kids?           |
|Do you think the story is cohesive?|  Story is very compelling evokes good emotion. I liked that it introduced the concept and how social justice overlaps with it, because social justice could be perceived as controversial. | Yeah I like how it was the four things and where are the 4 things and why it’s important.  |   Yes.          |  Yes? But I do have a comment about your conclusion, you say that black and latino kids but it seems that the sugar tax would be regressive and make their food more expensive?           |
| What do you think about the aesthetics of the website?|It worked very well.| I think it looked good, the only issue was some of the graphs with the orange was slightly challenging for me see.   |   Yes, I like the color theme.         |   I think they’re pretty good, I thought they made sense being next to each other and blending, but I feel some of the graphs could be a bit more persuasive.          |
| Was there anything you found confusing about the website?| Image association with some of the statistics, making conclusions that weren’t intended.| No, I think the only thing was when you have the UPFs I didn’t get what ultra-processed foods was. At the end it says to reach out to our congress person to reach out to our food and maybe give them a sentence to copy and paste and send it to them.|   The 2x thing where is it like do only black kids see it are they 2x more likely? I didn’t understand what the first graph was trying to show, like what is the percentage in terms of? Is it of the overall diet?          | 	I think the first graph is a bit confusing like it’s not immediately clear what is being presented. And the one the one that showed the top 4 causes of death I think would be more striking that were way below the top 4 causes.          |

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The picture of the Kellogg's box confuses people into thinking the statistic is about Kellogg's specifically. | Look for a picture that matches the color theme but includes more than one brand. |
|   It's not immediately apparent that UPF = ultra-processed food                                       |                               Include UPF in parentheses first few times I mention ultra-processd food.                                                  |
|  Some users may be discouraged by not knowing what to write to their Congressperson.                                       |         Include a letter people can copy and paste to send to their Congressperson.                                                                        |
|    The statistic about Black children seeing ads 2x more than their white counterparts is confusing.                                      |     I don't think I'll do anything about this, only one person mentioned it and I think the statistic is generally straightforward.                                                                            |
| The orange in the graphs may be a bit difficult too.           |      Make the orange in the graphs a bit darker.                                                                           |
|  Some people may think sugar taxes might be regressive in making food more expensive for minority groups.                                       |        Emphasize that a sugar tax would be on sugary drinks only by underlining drinks.                                                                         |
|   The firt chart is not very clear to some users.                                       |       Change the title of the graph to "More than half of calories in the staple "Western Diet" comes from UPFS.                                                                          |
