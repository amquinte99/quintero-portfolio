# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

I am hoping to target White U.S. citizens, so these are the folks I sought out to interview.

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  To understand what people are leaving with from the website.    |  What are you getting out of the website?              |
| To see who they think the website is targeting.     |  Who do you think the target audience is?               |
| To understand if they think the story flows well.     |  Do you think the story is cohesive?                |
| To see if they like the way the website looks.     |  What do you think about the aesthetics of the website?               |
|  To understand if there is anything prohibiting people from gathering the general idea.    |  Was there anything you found confusing about the website?               |
