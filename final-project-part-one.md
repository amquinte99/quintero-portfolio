# Outline
 
### High-Level Summary
Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have become deeply ingrained in the American diet. Despite widespread awareness of their negative health effects, consumption remains high. While cost is often cited as the primary reason, the issue extends beyond affordability. High-sugar, ultra-processed foods are not just accessible—they are addictive.

Though these foods may appear inexpensive at the grocery store, their true cost is far greater. UPFs contribute significantly to rising healthcare expenses, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income communities. The burden of diet-related illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease, falls heavily on these populations, driving up medical costs and straining public health systems.

Education alone has proven insufficient in curbing consumption. Policymakers must take a more active role in regulating the food industry. Sugar taxes, for example, have been shown to reduce consumption and improve public health outcomes. More lawmakers should recognize their effectiveness and advocate for policies that create meaningful barriers to the unchecked sale of harmful, ultra-processed foods.

### Story Structure 
Setup: The American diet is made up of over 50% ultra processed foods (UPFs).

Conflict: UPFs have a positive association with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. These NCDs make up more than 90% of health care spending. 

Resolution: Sugar taxes are associated with a 33% decline of sugary food purchases.

# The data 
I will use my data sources to illustrate the widespread consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) in the U.S., showing that they make up more than half of the American diet—significantly higher than in other countries. I will also highlight how the U.S. has one of the highest obesity rates globally.

Next, I will use data to demonstrate the strong link between obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes and heart disease, and how these conditions drive a substantial portion of U.S. healthcare spending. Finally, I will present evidence on the effectiveness of sugar taxes, proving that they are a well-supported policy intervention rather than an arbitrary solution.
