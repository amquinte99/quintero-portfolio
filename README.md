# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hello! My name is Alyssa Quintero, a lot of people call me Aly. My pronouns are she/her/hers and as of January 14, 2025, I am in my second year of my Master's of Public Policy and management degree at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I was born and raised in Miami, FL and moved out at 18 to attend Syracuse University as a Posse Scholar and graduated with a dual degree in Chemistry and Environment, Sustainability and Policy. I then worked in Wasington, D.C. for two years at a government affairs firm working on environmental policy and then came to CMU.

I came to CMU to build up my technical skills and take classes exactly like this one. I'm super excited to learn from this class and use the more creative side of my brain. 

# What I hope to learn
In this course I'm interested in learning the best ways to display different kinds of information; how to ensure my data visualizations are accessible by all; and best practices for data visualizations. 

After this class I hope to be working in environmental policy and use the skills I've built up to try and make some sort of positive influence in the world.
