# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
Based on the feedback from my interviews, I made several anticipated changes to Part III of my website. One change was replacing the image accompanying my "70%" statistic. Initially, I had a picture of a Kellogg’s box, but an interviewer pointed out that it made them assume the statistic was specifically about Kellogg’s products. To avoid this confusion, I changed the image to one showing an aisle of cereal boxes, which better represents the broader context of the statistic.

Another adjustment was adding "UPF" (ultra-processed foods) in parentheses the first few times I mentioned it. I was initially hesitant to include it in titles, but I ultimately decided it would improve user understanding.

Additionally, I originally had a generic call to action that simply encouraged users to "reach out to your congressperson!" An interviewer suggested that providing a sample letter would be more effective, and I agreed. As a result, I created a letter to make it easier for users to take action.

I also made a small but important change regarding the sugary drink tax. To clarify that the tax applies specifically to sugary drinks—not sugary foods—I underlined the word "drinks" whenever I mentioned it. This was to ensure readers understood that the policy would not negatively impact the very people it aims to help by making healthier food options more available.

Finally, I revised the title of my first chart to: "How does the Western diet compare globally? Ranking countries by ultra-processed foods (UPFs) as a share of total caloric intake." This change helps guide readers toward the correct interpretation of the data, as I realized the original title did not clearly indicate that the percentages represented UPFs as a share of total caloric intake. I found this revision to be particularly helpful in making the data more accessible.

## The audience
For my audience, I ultimately chose white, upper-middle-class and wealthy U.S. citizens. As I state on my website, the people most affected by this issue are lower-income minorities, but I did not target them because they do not need to be educated on a reality they are already living.

Initially, I considered tailoring the website toward policymakers, urging them to sponsor legislation in their states. However, in my Policy Analysis in Practice course, we discussed the complexities of how and why policymakers introduce legislation.

One key takeaway was that many legislators genuinely want to pass meaningful policies, but they often don’t move forward with certain proposals simply because they don’t see a viable path to passage. Legislative action is often driven by national climate—when a major event shifts public sentiment, making it easier for lawmakers to reach consensus and enact change. A historical example is 9/11, which unified Congress around specific policy decisions.

Thinking about this project more holistically—beyond just earning points for my class—I believe mobilizing constituents to pressure legislators would be more impactful than simply presenting legislators with a website. A single website created by one person is unlikely to sway policymakers, but a flood of emails from engaged constituents could create the pressure necessary for action. This website, therefore, serves as a tool to build that momentum, contributing to a broader national conversation around ultra-processed foods (UPFs).

Right now, there is a growing public focus on UPFs, weight loss, and drugs like Ozempic, making this an opportune moment to engage people who have the power to influence legislative priorities. That’s why I chose to target white, upper-middle-class and above U.S. citizens—because their voices are often heard in political spaces and can help drive broader change.

I recognize that this decision may be too broad, and you might find it disappointing. However, given the structural realities of policy change, I think this approach would be the most effective in achieving real impact.
